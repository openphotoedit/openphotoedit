 * permanent commitment — each new string in the product needs a
 * translation in all of them, forever, and a half-translated interface
 * reads worse than an English one.
 *
 * `name` is the language's name *in that language*. A picker that lists
 * "Chinese (Simplified)" in English is no use to someone who cannot read
 * English, which is the entire audience for the control.
 *
 * All eight are left-to-right. Adding Arabic or Hebrew later is a layout
 * change (`dir="rtl"`, logical CSS properties) and not just a
 * translation — worth knowing before anyone promises one.
