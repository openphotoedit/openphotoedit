/**
 * Translation, with no runtime dependency.
 *
 * ## Why the English text is the key
 *
 * `t("Save a copy")` rather than `t("toolbar.saveAs")`. That is gettext's
 * convention and Apple's, and it earns its place here for three reasons:
 *
 * - **A missing translation degrades to English**, not to `toolbar.saveAs`
 *   on a button. With the interface strings across eight locales there will always
 *   be a gap somewhere, and the failure has to be survivable.
 * - **The replacement is mechanical.** Wrapping a literal cannot change
 *   what the interface says, so this can be applied across 27 components
 *   without re-reading each one for intent.
 * - **The catalogue reads as prose**, so a translator sees the sentence
 *   rather than a key they have to go and look up.
 *
 * The cost is that editing English copy orphans its translations. That is
 * the right trade while English is the source of truth: a changed
 * sentence *should* be re-translated, and `missing()` below makes the gap
 * visible instead of silent.
 *
 * ## Why no library
 *
 * svelte-i18n and i18next both bring a store layer, an ICU parser and
 * async loading. This app is local-first and ships inside a browser
 * extension and an iOS bundle, where every kilobyte is one someone waits
 * for. Eight catalogues of 176 short strings are about 15 KB gzipped
 * altogether, so they are imported statically: no async, no loading
 * state, and no flash of untranslated text on a cold start with no
 * network — which is the state this app is designed to work in.
